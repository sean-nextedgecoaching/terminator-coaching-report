            <p><strong>"AI can't offer real empathy"</strong> False. GPT-based systems outscored doctors in perceived empathy in peer-reviewed studies. Doctors. The people we trust with our lives think AI is more understanding.</p>
            
            <p><strong>"AI can't coach intuition"</strong> Your "gut feeling" is just pattern recognition with anxiety and a psychology degree. AI processes 10x more behavioral patterns than your nervous system can track.</p>
            
            <p><strong>"My clients love me"</strong> They love results. If something delivers faster, cheaper insights without asking them to "sit with discomfort" for 45 minutes, they'll switch faster than you can say "mindfulness."</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Executive coaching is too complex for AI"</strong> Executives already get real-time decision support from AI. Adding empathy and career guidance is Tuesday's update, not next decade's breakthrough.</p>

                P.S. This transmission was written in collaboration with Claude AI. Yes, I used artificial intelligence to warn you about artificial intelligence replacing coaches.<br>
                The irony isn't lost on me‚Äîit's the entire point.<br>
                If AI can craft compelling arguments about complex business disruption, analyze industry trends, and write in my voice better than most human copywriters... what exactly makes you think your coaching is irreplaceable?<br>
                <strong>This document is living proof of everything I'm warning you about.</strong>
